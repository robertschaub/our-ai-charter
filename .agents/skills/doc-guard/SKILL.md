# /doc-guard - keep documentation lean and readable

Apply documentation guardrails to: $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose

Prevent documentation clutter: text, structure, or duplication that makes a
reader work harder without adding durable understanding. This is the
documentation counterpart to code debt guardrails.

Use `/doc-guard` before substantial documentation edits. Use `/docs-update`
afterward when status labels, README index entries, links, or the changelog
need to stay in sync.

## Required pre-edit output

For any substantial documentation edit, write this block before editing:

```
DOC-GUARD
Reader: <who needs this document or section>
Need: <the concrete question, decision, or action it serves>
Existing home: <current document/section that should carry it, or N/A>
Chosen option: tighten | amend | merge | move | delete | add
Rejected path and why worse: <the strongest alternative>
Lean test: <what would be removed if it does not serve the need>
Readability check: <status/source/link/structure check>
Docs-update needed after? yes | no
```

Small wording fixes can satisfy this with a one-line note. New documents,
large rewrites, status changes, or public-facing framing changes need the full
block.

## Rules

1. Start from the reader need. Do not add text just because a related idea is
   interesting, true, or recently discussed.
2. Prefer tightening, amending, merging, moving, or deleting before adding a
   new section or document.
3. Keep one authoritative home for each idea. Link rather than repeat unless
   the repetition is needed for standalone comprehension.
4. Cut filler: throat-clearing, generic values language, obvious caveats,
   repeated summaries, placeholder sections, process history, and ornamental
   transitions.
5. Keep claims concrete and sourceable. Avoid broad promises, marketing tone,
   unexplained abstractions, and unsupported certainty.
6. Use headings, tables, and lists only when they improve scanning. Do not add
   structure as decoration.
7. Preserve necessary nuance, including minority interpretations, but make the
   contrast concise and tied to the document's purpose.
8. Before adding a new document, verify that it has a durable audience, a clear
   status label, a distinct home in the repository, and no better existing
   target.

## Post-edit reconciliation

Before declaring done, compare the diff against the `DOC-GUARD` block:

- Remove text that did not satisfy the stated reader need.
- Merge or link duplicated explanations.
- Check that headings match the actual content under them.
- Check status labels, links, README index entries, and changelog impact.
- Confirm no private, internal, personal, or secret material was introduced.

## Review mode

When asked to review a documentation diff, lead with deletion and
simplification candidates. Flag duplicated ideas, unclear reader need,
over-broad claims, stale links, status-label drift, placeholder sections,
unnecessary background, and any text that reads as persuasion rather than
clear public documentation.

## Clarity and readability passes

A tightening pass removes filler — but the same edit easily strips load-bearing
substance, and this repo has lost and re-added the same content more than once
that way. When tightening, cut only genuine filler and **preserve**:

- **Named principles and their reasoning** — anti-capture, honesty, privacy,
  least-exposure, fail-safe — not just the adjective ("plural and neutral"
  without "a captured registry is a captured market" is a hollowed-out
  principle).
- **Sourced specifics** — numbers, dates, named entities, and citations,
  especially in evidence/scan docs whose value *is* their sources.
- **Mission tie-ins** — the democracy-and-justice purpose and the
  resilience/economic-prosperity framing.
- **Concrete spines** — a specific mechanism or example beats a generic
  adjective string ("open, plural, accountable") that could describe anything.

After the pass, diff it against the prior version and confirm no principle,
source, or mission tie-in was flattened into a generic phrase.

## Hard stops

Ask the maintainer before deleting or materially changing published normative
text, changing a document's maturity label, retiring or moving a public
document, adding material that may need private context, or publishing claims
whose sources or licensing are uncertain.
